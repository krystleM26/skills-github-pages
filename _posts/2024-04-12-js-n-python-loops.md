Title: "Loops in Javascript and Python Explained"
Date: 2024-04-12

### Different programming languages use the same functionality but with different syntax. This post shares the For-loop and While-Loop syntax for Javascript and Python.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; I < arr.length; i++) {
  statement
}
```

```python
for i in range(count):
    statement
```

```javascript
  while(condition is true) {
    statement
}
```

```python
while condition:
    statement
```

```python
 if num == 0:
    print("Your num is 0 ")
 elif num > 0:
    print( "your num is negative ")
 else:
    print(" " )
    

### As you can see in the above code blocks, the two iterations are similar when it comes to using the algorithms, but the syntaxes are different

### Note: Please note that while loops and if-statements in python are booleans
