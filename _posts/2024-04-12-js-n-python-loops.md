### Different programming languages use the same functionality but with different syntax. This post shares the For-loop and While-Loop syntax for Javascript and Python.

```javascript
for(let i = 0; I < arr.length; i++) {
  statement
}
```

```python
for i in range(count):
    statement
```

```javascript
  while(condition is true) {
    statement
}
```

```python
while condition:
    statement
```

### As you can see in the above code blocks, the two iterations are similar when it comes to using the algorithms, but the syntaxes are different
